methods of succession to queendoms kingdoms tribal chiefships and such include nomination when the sitting monarch or a council names an heir primogeniture when the children of a monarch or chief become regents in order of birth from eldest to youngest and ultimogeniture when the children become regents in the reverse order of birth from youngest to eldest the scope of succession may be matrilineal patrilineal or both or rarely open to general election when necessary the right of succession may be open to men and women or limited to men only or women only margaret i ruled denmark sweden and norway in the late 14th and early 15th centuries the most typical succession in european monarchies from the late middle ages through most of the twentieth century was malepreference primogeniture ie the order of succession cycled through the sons of the monarch in order of their birth followed by the daughters or grandsons historically many realms which forbade succession by women or through a female line in obedience to the salic law and some which still do no queen regnant ever ruled france for example only one woman maria theresa ruled austria as noted in the list below of widely known ruling queens many ruled in european monarchies in the waning days of the 20th century and early days of the 21st sweden norway belgium the netherlands and denmark amended their acts of succession to absolute primogeniture in some cases the change does not take effect during the lifetimes of people already in the line of succession at the time the law was passed in 2011 the 16 realms of the british commonwealth agreed to remove the rule of malepreference primogeniture once the necessary legislation is passed this means that had prince william had a daughter first a younger son would not become heir apparent 1 the jaguar panthera onca is a big cat a feline in the panthera genus and is the only panthera species found in the americas the jaguar is the thirdlargest feline after the tiger and the lion and the largest in the western hemisphere the jaguars present range extends from southwestern united states and mexico across much of central america and south to paraguay and northern argentina apart from a known and possibly breeding population in arizona southeast of tucson the cat has largely been extirpated from the united states since the early 20th century queens popularity was stimulated in the united states when bohemian rhapsody was featured in the 1992 comedy film waynes world 146 its inclusion helped the song reach number two on the billboard hot 100 for five weeks in 1992 it remained in the hot 100 for over 40 weeks 146 and won the band an mtv award at the 1992 mtv video music awards 147 the compilation album classic queen also reached number four on the billboard 200 and is certified three times platinum in the us 16 146 waynes world footage was used to make a new music video for bohemian rhapsody with which the band and management were delighted 148 this spotted cat most closely resembles the leopard physically although it is usually larger and of sturdier build and its behavioral and habitat characteristics are closer to those of the tiger while dense rainforest is its preferred habitat the jaguar will range across a variety of forested and open terrains it is strongly associated with the presence of water and is notable along with the tiger as a feline that enjoys swimming the jaguar is largely a solitary opportunistic stalkandambush predator at the top of the food chain an apex predator it is a keystone species playing an important role in stabilizing ecosystems and regulating the populations of the animals it hunts the jaguar has an exceptionally powerful bite even relative to the other big cats 3 this allows it to pierce the shells of armored reptiles 4 and to employ an unusual killing method it bites directly through the skull of prey between the ears to deliver a fatal bite to the brain 5 the jaguar is a near threatened species and its numbers are declining threats include loss and fragmentation of habitat while international trade in jaguars or their parts is prohibited the cat is still frequently killed by humans particularly in conflicts with ranchers and farmers in south america although reduced its range remains large given its historical distribution the jaguar has featured prominently in the mythology of numerous indigenous american cultures including those of the maya and aztec monarchs have various titles — king or queen prince or princess eg sovereign prince of monaco emperor or empress eg emperor of japan emperor of india archduke duke or grand duke eg grand duke of luxembourg prince is sometimes used as a generic term to describe any monarch regardless of title especially in older texts many monarchs are distinguished by titles and styles they often take part in certain ceremonies such as a coronation monarchy is political or sociocultural in nature and is generally but not always associated with hereditary rule most monarchs both historically and in the modern day have been born and brought up within a royal family whose rule over a period of time is referred to as a dynasty and trained for future duties different systems of succession have been used such as proximity of blood primogeniture and agnatic seniority salic law while traditionally most monarchs have been male female monarchs have also ruled and the term queen regnant refers to a ruling monarch as distinct from a queen consort the wife of a reigning king some monarchies are nonhereditary in an elective monarchy the monarch is elected but otherwise serves as any other monarch historical examples of elective monarchy include the holy roman emperors chosen by princeelectors but often coming from the same dynasty and the free election of kings of the polish–lithuanian commonwealth modern examples include the yang dipertuan agong of malaysia and the pope of the roman catholic church who serves as sovereign of the vatican city state and is elected to a life term by the college of cardinals monarchies have existed throughout the world although in recent centuries many states have abolished the monarchy and become republics advocacy of republics is called republicanism while advocacy of monarchies is called monarchism the principal advantage of hereditary monarchy is the immediate continuity of leadership with a usually short interregnum as illustrated in the classic phrase the old king is dead long live the new king however this only applies in the case of autocratic rule in cases where the monarch serves mostly as a ceremonial figure eg most modern constitutional monarchies real leadership does not depend on the monarch a form of government may in fact be hereditary without being considered monarchy such as a family dictatorship there are more than 7500 known cultivars of apples resulting in a range of desired characteristics different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses including cooking fresh eating and cider production domestic apples are generally propagated by grafting although wild apples grow readily from seed trees are prone to a number of fungal bacterial and pest problems which can be controlled by a number of organic and nonorganic means while jaguars now live only in the americas they are descended from old world cats two million years ago scientists believe the jaguar and its closest relative the similarly spotted leopard shared a common ancestor in asia 19 in the early pleistocene the forerunners of modern jaguars crossed beringia the land bridge that once spanned the bering strait and connected asia and north america these jaguar ancestors then moved south into central and south america feeding on the deer and other grazing animals that once covered the landscape in huge herds 19 about 69 million tons of apples were grown worldwide in 2010 and china produced almost half of this total the united states is the secondleading producer with more than 6 of world production turkey is third followed by italy india and poland apples are often eaten raw but can also be found in many prepared foods especially desserts and drinks many beneficial health effects are thought to result from eating apples however two forms of allergies are seen to various proteins found in the fruit in botany a fruit is a part of a flowering plant that derives from specific tissues of the flower one or more ovaries and in some cases accessory tissues fruits are the means by which these plants disseminate seeds many of them that bear edible fruits in particular have propagated with the movements of humans and animals in a symbiotic relationship as a means for seed dispersal and nutrition respectively in fact humans and many animals have become dependent on fruits as a source of food 1 fruits account for a substantial fraction of the worlds agricultural output and some such as the apple and the pomegranate have acquired extensive cultural and symbolic meanings in common language usage fruit normally means the fleshy seedassociated structures of a plant that are sweet or sour and edible in the raw state such as apples oranges grapes strawberries bananas and lemons on the other hand the botanical sense of fruit includes many structures that are not commonly called fruits such as bean pods corn kernels wheat grains and tomatoes 2 3 the section of a fungus that produces spores is also called a fruiting body like all cats the jaguar is an obligate carnivore feeding only on meat it is an opportunistic hunter and its diet encompasses at least 87 species 33 the jaguar can take virtually any terrestrial or riparian vertebrate found in central or south america with a preference for large prey the jaguar is more of a dietary generalist than its old world cousins the american tropics have a high diversity of small animals but relatively low populations and diversity of the large ungulates which this genus favors 49 they regularly take adult caimans 50 deer capybaras tapirs peccaries dogs foxes and sometimes even anacondas 20 however the cat will eat any small species that can be caught including frogs mice birds mainly groundbased species such as cracids fish sloths monkeys and turtles a study conducted in cockscomb basin wildlife sanctuary in belize for example revealed that the diets of jaguars there consisted primarily of armadillos and pacas 44 some jaguars will also take domestic livestock including adult cattle and horses 51 there is evidence that jaguars in the wild consume the roots of banisteriopsis caapi 52 while the jaguar often employs the deep throatbite and suffocation technique typical among panthera it sometimes uses a killing method unique amongst cats it pierces directly through the temporal bones of the skull between the ears of prey especially the capybara with its canine teeth piercing the brain 53 this may be an adaptation to cracking open turtle shells following the late pleistocene extinctions armored reptiles such as turtles would have formed an abundant prey base for the jaguar 33 48 the skull bite is employed with mammals in particular with reptiles such as the caiman the jaguar may leap onto the back of the prey and sever the cervical vertebrae immobilizing the target while capable of cracking turtle shells the jaguar may simply smash into the shell with its paw and scoop out the flesh 41 when attacking sea turtles as they try to nest on beaches the jaguar will bite at the head often beheading the prey before dragging it off to eat 54 reportedly while hunting horses a jaguar may leap onto their back place one paw on the muzzle and another on the nape and then twist dislocating the neck local people have anecdotally reported that when hunting a pair of horses bound together the jaguar will kill one horse and then drag it while the other horse still living is dragged in their wake 55 with prey such as smaller dogs a paw swipe to the skull may be sufficient to kill it apple inc is an american multinational corporation headquartered in cupertino california

suites panthera is a genus within the felidae family that was named and first described by the german naturalist oken in 1816 2 the british taxonomist pocock revised the classification of this genus in 1916 as comprising the species tiger lion jaguar and leopard on the basis of cranial features 3 results of genetic analysis indicate that the snow leopard also belongs to the panthera a classification that was accepted by iucn assessors in 2008 4 5 only the tiger lion leopard and jaguar have the anatomical structure that enables them to roar the primary reason for this was formerly assumed to be the incomplete ossification of the hyoid bone however new studies show the ability to roar is due to other morphological features especially of the larynx the snow leopard does not roar although it has an incomplete ossification of the hyoid bone it lacks the special morphology of the larynx 6 apple was founded by steve jobs steve wozniak and ronald wayne on april 1 1976 to develop

they have been associated with include progressive rock 217 glam rock 217 hard rock 217 heavy metal 217 pop rock 217 psychedelic rock 219 blues rock and dancedisco 220 queen also wrote songs that were inspired by genres that are not typically associated with rock such as ragtime opera gospel vaudeville and folk in 1963 the teenage brian may and his father custombuilt his signature guitar red special which was purposely designed to feedback 221 222 sonic experimentation figured heavily in queens songs a distinctive characteristic of queens music are the vocal harmonies which are usually composed of the voices of may mercury and taylor best heard on the studio albums a night at the opera and a day at the races some of the ground work for the development of this sound can be attributed to their former producer roy thomas baker and their engineer mike stone 223 224 besides vocal harmonies queen were also known for multitracking voices to imitate the sound of a large choir through overdubs for instance according to brian may there are over 180 vocal overdubs in bohemian rhapsody 225 many queen songs were also written with audience participation in mind such as we will rock you

vocals piano brian may guitar vocals john deacon bass guitar and roger taylor drums vocals queens earliest works were influenced by progressive rock hard rock and heavy metal but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radiofriendly works incorporating further diverse styles into their music before joining queen brian may and roger taylor had been playing together in a band named smile with bassist tim staffell freddie mercury then known as farrokhfreddie bulsara was a fan of smile and encouraged them to experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques after staffells departure in 1970 mercury himself joined the band shortly thereafter changed the name of the band to queen and adopted his familiar stage name john deacon was recruited prior to recording their eponymous debut album 1973 queen enjoyed success in the uk with their debut and its followup queen ii 1974 but it was the release of sheer heart attack 1974 and a night at the opera 1975 that

never made a profit 28 over the next few years it became clear that because of the low regard for many of the groups products insufficient capital could be provided to develop and begin manufacture of new models including jaguars particularly if jaguar were to remain a part of the group 22 in july 1984 jaguar was floated off as a separate company on the stock market – one of the thatcher governments many privatisations 23 – to create its own track record 24 and find new supplies or the governments preference a new supplier of capital —which turned out to be ford installed as chairman in 1980 sir john egan was hailed as an industrial superman for jaguars unprecedented prosperity immediately after privatisation in early 1986 egan reported he had tackled 1 poor quality control 2 lagging delivery schedules 3 poor productivity and laid off about 13 of the companys 10000 employees to cut costs 25 commentators have since pointed out he exploited an elderly model range on which all development costs had been written off and raised prices as well as intensifying the push to improve jaguars quality but in the usa the price rises were masked by a favourable exchange rate 26

officially supported on a regional carriers network 190 another notable feature of the iphone 4s was siri voice assistant technology which apple had acquired in 2010 191 as well as other features including an updated 8mp camera with new optics apple sold 4 million iphone 4s phones in the first three days of availability 192 on september 12 2012 apple i cooking apples 1 culinary apples such as the bramley empire northern spy or granny smith are crisp and acidic the fruit for the pie can be fresh canned or reconstituted from dried apples this affects the final texture and the length of cooking time required whether it has an effect on the flavour of the pie is a matter of opinion dried or preserved apples were originally substituted only at times when fresh fruit was unavailable apple pie is often served in the style of a la mode topped with ice cream alternatively a piece of cheese such as a sharp cheddar is occasionally placed on top of or alongside a slice of the finished pie 2 3 4 he largescale productionline manufacturing of affordable automobiles was debuted by ransom olds in 1902 at his oldsmobile factory located in lansing michigan and based upon the assembly line techniques pioneered by marc isambard brunel at the portsmouth block mills england in 1802 the assembly line style of mass production and interchangeable parts had been pioneered in the us by thomas blanchard in 1821 at the springfield armory in springfield massachusetts 24 this concept was greatly expanded by henry ford beginning in 1914 as a result fords cars came off the line in fifteenminute intervals much faster than previous methods increasing productivity eightfold requiring 125manhours before 1hour 33 minutes after while using less manpower 25 it was so successful paint became a bottleneck only japan black would dry fast enough forcing the company to drop the variety of colors available before 1914 until fastdrying duco lacquer was developed in 1926 this is the source of fords apocryphal remark any color as long as its black 25 in 1914 an assembly line worker could buy a model t with four months pay 25 portrait of henry ford ca 1919 rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as rock and roll in the united states in the 1950s and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later particularly in the united kingdom and the united states 1 2 it has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll itself heavily influenced by rhythm and blues and country music rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as blues and folk and incorporated influences from jazz classical and other musical sources musically rock has centered on the electric guitar usually as part of a rock group with bass guitar and drums typically rock is songbased music usually with a 44 time signature using a versechorus form but the genre has become extremely diverse like pop music lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political in emphasis the dominance of rock by white male musicians has been seen as one of the key factors shaping the themes explored in rock music rock places a higher degree of emphasis on musicianship live performance and an ideology of authenticity than pop music fords complex safety procedures—especially assigning each worker to a specific location instead of allowing them to roam about—dramatically reduced the rate of injury the combination of high wages and high efficiency is called fordism and was copied by most major industries the efficiency gains from the assembly line also coincided with the economic rise of the united states the assembly line forced workers to work at a certain pace with very repetitive motions which led to more output per worker while other countries were using less productive methodsntroduced the iphone 5 193 it added a 4inch display 4g lte connectivity and the upgraded apple a6 chip among several other improvements 194 two million iphones were sold in the first twentyfour hours of preordering 195 and over five million handsets were sold in the first three days of its launch 196 a patent filed in july 2013 revealed the development of a new iphone battery system that uses location data in combination with data on the users habits to moderate the handsets power settings accordingly apple is working towards a power management system that will provide features such as the ability of the iphone to estimate the length of time a user will be away from a power source to modify energy usage and a detection function that adjusts the charging rate to best suit the type of power source that is being used 197 in march 2013 one of the largest cellular phone companies in the united states tmobile announced that it would begin selling the iphone 5 on april 12 the announcement of the iphone came with the announcement that the company would begin implementing 4g cellular service for its users 198 upon the launch of the iphone 5s and iphone 5c apple sold over nine million devices in the first three days of its launch which sets a new record for firstweekend smartphone sales 199 this was the first time that apple has simultaneously launched two models and the inclusion of china in the list of markets contributed to the record sales result 200 on october 15 2013 us cellular the united states fifth largest cell phone provider announced that it would in fact begin to carry the iphone it is the last of the five major carriers including att verizon sprint and tmobile to acquire the phone the phone went on sale on november 8 at us cellular stores around the country 201 the finalization of a deal between apple and china mobile the worlds largest mobile network was announced in late december 2013 the multiyear agreement provides iphone access to over 760 million china mobile subscribers 202 in a march 2014 interview ive used the iphone as an example of apples ethos of creating highquality lifechanging products explaining that they are comparatively expensive due to the intensive effort that is used to make them we don’t take so long and make the way we make for fiscal reasons quite the reverse the body is made from a single piece of machined aluminium the whole thing is polished first to a mirror finish and then is very finely textured except for the apple logo the chamfers smoothedoff edges are cut with diamondtipped cutters the cutters don’t usually last very long so we had to figure out a way of massmanufacturing longlasting ones the camera cover is sapphire crystal look at the details around the simcard slot it’s extraordinary 61 the apple forms a tree that is small and deciduous generally standing 18 to 46 m 6 to 15 ft tall in cultivation and up to 91 m 30 ft in the wild when cultivated the size shape and branch density is determined by rootstock selection and trimming method the leaves are alternately arranged dark greencolored simple ovals with serrated margins and slightly downy undersides 3 blossoms are produced in spring simultaneously with the budding of the leaves and are produced on spurs and some long shoots the 3 to 4 cm 12 to 16 in flowers are white with a pink tinge that gradually fades five petaled with an inflorescence consisting of a cyme with 4–6 flowers the central flower of the inflorescence is called the king bloom it opens first and can develop a larger fruit 3 4 the fruit matures in autumn and varieties exist with a wide range of sizes commercial growers aim to produce an apple that is 70 to 83 cm 275 to 325 in in diameter due to market preference some consumers especially those in japan prefer a larger apple while apples below 57 cm 225 in are generally used for making juice and have little fresh market value the skin of ripe apples is generally red yellow green or pink although many bi or tricolored varieties may be found 5 the skin may also be wholly or partly russeted ie rough and brown the skin is covered in a protective layer of epicuticular wax 6 the flesh is generally pale yellowishwhite 5 though pink or yellow flesh is also known apples are often eaten raw the whole fruit including the skin is suitable for human consumption except for the seeds which may affect some consumers the core is often not eaten and is discarded varieties bred for raw consumption are termed dessert or table apples apples can be canned or juiced they are milled or pressed to produce apple juice which may be drunk unfiltered called apple cider in north america or filtered the juice can be fermented to make cider called hard cider in north america ciderkin and vinegar through distillation various alcoholic beverages can be produced such as applejack calvados 62 and apfelwein apple seed oil 63 and pectin may also be produced apples are an important ingredient in many desserts such as apple pie apple crumble apple crisp and apple cake they are often eaten baked or stewed and they can also be dried and eaten or reconstituted soaked in water alcohol or some other liquid for later use puréed apples are generally known as apple sauce apples are also made into apple butter and apple jelly they are also used cooked in meat dishes in the uk a toffee apple is a traditional confection made by coating an apple in hot toffee and allowing it to cool similar treats in the us are candy apples coated in a hard shell of crystallized sugar syrup and caramel apples coated with cooled caramel traditional dutch apple pie comes in two varieties a crumb appelkruimeltaart and a lattice appeltaart style pie both recipes are distinct in that they typically call for flavourings such as cinnamon and lemon juice to be added and differ in texture not taste 6 dutch apple pies may include ingredients such as raisins and icing in addition to ingredients such as apples and sugar which they have in common with other recipes 7 recipes for dutch apple pie go back centuries there exists a painting from the dutch golden age dated 1626 featuring such a pie a recipe in a late medieval dutch cook book een notabel boecxken van cokeryen from around 1514 8 is almost identical to modern recipes the basis of dutch apple pie is a crust on the bottom and around the edges this is then filled with pieces or slices of apple usually a crisp and mildly tart variety such as goudreinet or elstar cinnamon and sugar are generally mixed in with the apple filling atop the filling strands of dough cover the pie in a lattice holding the filling in place but keeping it visible or cover the pie with crumbs it can be eaten warm or cold sometimes with a dash of whipped cream or vanilla ice cream in the us dutch apple pie refers specifically to the apple pie style with a crumb streusel topping 9 apples are eaten with honey at the jewish new year of rosh hashanah to symbolize a sweet new year 62 farms with apple orchards may open them to the public so consumers may themselves pick the apples they will purchase 62 one form of apple allergy often found in northern europe is called birchapple syndrome and is found in people who are also allergic to birch pollen 67 allergic reactions are triggered by a protein in apples that is similar to birch pollen and people affected by this protein can also develop allergies to other fruits nuts and vegetables reactions which entail oral allergy syndrome oas generally involve itching and inflammation of the mouth and throat 67 but in rare cases can also include lifethreatening anaphylaxis 68 this reaction only occurs when raw fruit is consumed—the allergen is neutralized in the cooking process the variety of apple maturity and storage conditions can change the amount of allergen present in individual fruits long storage times can increase the amount of proteins that cause birchapple syndrome 67 different kinds of apple cultivars in a wholesale food market by the late 1960s referred to as the golden age 3 or classic rock 1 period a number of distinct rock music subgenres had emerged including hybrids like blues rock folk rock country rock and jazzrock fusion many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock which was influenced by the countercultural psychedelic scene new genres that emerged from this scene included progressive rock which extended the artistic elements glam rock which highlighted showmanship and visual style and the diverse and enduring major subgenre of heavy metal which emphasized volume power and speed in the second half of the 1970s punk rock both intensified and reacted against some of these trends to produce a raw energetic form of music characterized by overt political and social critiques punk was an influence into the 1980s on the subsequent development of other subgenres including new wave postpunk and eventually the alternative rock movement from the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break through into the mainstream in the form of grunge britpop and indie rock further fusion subgenres have since emerged including pop punk rap rock and rap metal as well as conscious attempts to revisit rocks history including the garage rockpostpunk and synthpop revivals at the beginning of the new millennium rock music has also embodied and served as the vehicle for cultural and social movements leading to major subcultures including mods and rockers in the uk and the hippie counterculture that spread out from san francisco in the us in the 1960s similarly 1970s punk culture spawned the visually distinctive goth and emo subcultures inheriting the folk tradition of the protest song rock music has been associated with political activism as well as changes in social attitudes to race sex and drug use and is often seen as an expression of youth revolt against adult consumerism and conformity in other areas such as the mediterranean some individuals have adverse reactions to apples because of their similarity to peaches 67 this form of apple allergy also includes oas but often has more severe symptoms such as vomiting abdominal pain and urticaria and can be lifethreatening individuals with this form of allergy can also develop reactions to other fruits and nuts cooking does not break down the protein causing this particular reaction so affected individuals can eat neither raw nor cooked apples freshly harvested overripe fruits tend to have the highest levels of the protein that causes this reaction 67 computer software or simply software also known as computer programs is the nontangible component of computers computer software contrasts with computer hardware which is the physical component of computers computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used without the other computer hardware is the collection of physical elements that constitutes a computer system computer hardware refers to the physical parts or components of a computer such as the monitor mouse keyboard computer data storage hard drive disk hdd system unit graphic cards sound cards memory motherboard and chips etc all of which are physical objects that can be touched 1 in contrast software is instructions that can be stored and run by hardware literature is a term that does not have a universally accepted definition but which has variably included all written work writing that possesses literary merit and language that foregrounds literariness as opposed to ordinary language etymologically the term derives from latin literaturalitteratura writing formed with letters although some definitions include spoken or sung texts literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or nonfiction and whether it is poetry or prose it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel short story or drama and works are often categorised according to historical periods or according to their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations genre taken to mean only written works literature was first produced by some of the worlds earliest civilizations—those of ancient egypt and sumeria—as early as the 4th millennium bc taken to include spoken or sung texts it originated even earlier and some of the first written works may have been based on an alreadyexisting oral tradition as urban cultures and societies developed there was a proliferation in the forms of literature developments in print technology allowed for literature to be distributed and experienced on an unprecedented scale art is a diverse range of human activities and the products of those activities this article focuses primarily on the visual arts which includes the creation of images or objects in fields including painting sculpture printmaking photography and other visual media architecture is often included as one of the visual arts however like the decorative arts it involves the creation of objects where the practical considerations of use are essential—in a way that they usually are not in a painting for example music theatre film dance and other performing arts as well as literature and other media such as interactive media are included in a broader definition of art or the arts 1 until the 17th century art referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from crafts or sciences but in modern usage the fine arts where aesthetic considerations are paramount are distinguished from acquired skills in general such as the decorative or applied arts art may be characterized in terms of mimesis its reflection of life expression communication of emotion or other qualities during the romantic period art came to be seen as a special faculty of the human mind to be classified with religion and science 2 though the definition of what constitutes art is disputed 3 4 5 and has changed over time general descriptions mention an idea of imaginative or technical skill stemming from human agency 6 and creation 7 the nature of art and related concepts such as creativity and interpretation are explored in a branch of philosophy known as aesthetics 8 the original latin word universitas refers in general to a number of persons associated into one body a society company community guild corporation etc 2 at the time of the emergence of urban town life and medieval guilds specialised associations of students and teachers with collective legal rights usually guaranteed by charters issued by princes prelates or the towns in which they were located came to be denominated by this general term like other guilds they were selfregulating and determined the qualifications of their members 3 in modern usage the word has come to mean an institution of higher education offering tuition in mainly nonvocational subjects and typically having the power to confer degrees 4 with the earlier emphasis on its corporate organization considered as applying historically to medieval universities 5 the original latin word referred to degreegranting institutions of learning in western and central europe where this form of legal organisation was prevalent and from where the institution spread around the world for nonrelated educational institutions of antiquity which did not stand in the tradition of the university and to which the term is only loosely and retrospectively applied see ancient higherlearning institutions academic freedom edit an important idea in the definition of a university is the notion of academic freedom the first documentary evidence of this comes from early in the life of the first university the university of bologna adopted an academic charter the constitutio habita 6 in 1158 or 1155 7 which guaranteed the right of a traveling scholar to unhindered passage in the interests of education today this is claimed as the origin of academic freedom 8 this is now widely recognised internationally on 18 september 1988 430 university rectors signed the magna charta universitatum 9 marking the 900th anniversary of bolognas foundation the number of universities signing the magna charta universitatum continues to grow drawing from all parts of the world mathematics is the abstract study of topics such as quantity numbers 2 structure 3 space 2 and change 4 5 6 there is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics 7 8 mathematicians seek out patterns 9 10 and use them to formulate new conjectures mathematicians resolve the truth or falsity of conjectures by mathematical proof when mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena then mathematical reasoning can provide insight or predictions about nature through the use of abstraction and logic mathematics developed from counting calculation measurement and the systematic study of the shapes and motions of physical objects practical mathematics has been a human activity for as far back as written records exist the research required to solve mathematical problems can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry rigorous arguments first appeared in greek mathematics most notably in euclids elements since the pioneering work of giuseppe peano 1858–1932 david hilbert 1862–1943 and others on axiomatic systems in the late 19th century it has become customary to view mathematical research as establishing truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and definitions mathematics developed at a relatively slow pace until the renaissance when mathematical innovations interacting with new scientific discoveries led to a rapid increase in the rate of mathematical discovery that has continued to the present day 11 galileo galilei 1564–1642 said the universe cannot be read until we have learned the language and become familiar with the characters in which it is written it is written in mathematical language and the letters are triangles circles and other geometrical figures without which means it is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word without these one is wandering about in a dark labyrinth 12 carl friedrich gauss 1777–1855 referred to mathematics as the queen of the sciences 13 benjamin peirce 1809–1880 called mathematics the science that draws necessary conclusions 14 david hilbert said of mathematics we are not speaking here of arbitrariness in any sense mathematics is not like a game whose tasks are determined by arbitrarily stipulated rules rather it is a conceptual system possessing internal necessity that can only be so and by no means otherwise 15 albert einstein 1879–1955 stated that as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality they are not certain and as far as they are certain they do not refer to reality 16 french mathematician claire voisin states there is creative drive in mathematics its all about movement trying to express itself 17 mathematics is used throughout the world as an essential tool in many fields including natural science engineering medicine finance and the social sciences applied mathematics the branch of mathematics concerned with application of mathematical knowledge to other fields inspires and makes use of new mathematical discoveries which has led to the development of entirely new mathematical disciplines such as statistics and game theory mathematicians also engage in pure mathematics or mathematics for its own sake without having any application in mind there is no clear line separating pure and applied mathematics and practical applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered 18 earth is the third planet from the sun it is the densest and fifthlargest of the eight planets in the solar system it is also the largest of the solar systems four terrestrial planets it is sometimes referred to as the world or the blue planet 23 earth formed approximately 454 billion years ago and life appeared on its surface within its first billion years 24 earths biosphere then significantly altered the atmospheric and other basic physical conditions which enabled the proliferation of organisms as well as the formation of the ozone layer which together with earths magnetic field blocked harmful solar radiation and permitted formerly oceanconfined life to move safely to land 25 the physical properties of the earth as well as its geological history and orbit have allowed life to persist earths lithosphere is divided into several rigid segments or tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over periods of many millions of years over 70 percent of earths surface is covered with water 26 with the remainder consisting of continents and islands which together have many lakes and other sources of water that contribute to the hydrosphere earths poles are mostly covered with ice that is the solid ice of the antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice that is the polar ice packs the planets interior remains active with a solid iron inner core a liquid outer core that generates the magnetic field and a thick layer of relatively solid mantle earth gravitationally interacts with other objects in space especially the sun and the moon during one orbit around the sun the earth rotates about its own axis 36626 times creating 36526 solar days or one sidereal year note 6 the earths axis of rotation is tilted 234° away from the perpendicular of its orbital plane producing seasonal variations on the planets surface with a period of one tropical year 36524 solar days 27 the moon is earths only natural satellite it began orbiting the earth about 453 billion years ago bya the moons gravitational interaction with earth stimulates ocean tides stabilizes the axial tilt and gradually slows the planets rotation the planet is home to millions of species of life including humans 28 both the mineral resources of the planet and the products of the biosphere contribute resources that are used to support a global human population 29 these inhabitants are grouped into about 200 independent sovereign states which interact through diplomacy travel trade and military action
