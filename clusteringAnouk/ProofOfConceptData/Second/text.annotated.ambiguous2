an_1 important idea in_1 the definition of a university is the notion of academic freedom the first_1 documentary evidence of this_0 comes from_1 early in_1 the life of_0 the first_1 university the

rapid increase in the rate of_0 mathematical discovery that_1 has_1 continued to_0 the_0 present_0 day 11_1 galileo galilei 1564–1642 said the universe cannot be_0 read until we_1 have_1 learned the_0

mathematics as_0 the_0 queen_0 of_0 the_0 sciences 13_0 benjamin peirce 1809–1880 called_0 mathematics the_0 science that_1 draws necessary conclusions 14_1 david hilbert said of mathematics we_1 are not speaking here of_1 arbitrariness in any sense_0 mathematics is_1 not_0 like a game whose tasks are_0 determined by arbitrarily stipulated rules rather it is_1 a conceptual system_1 possessing internal necessity that_0 can_0 only be_0 so_0 and_0 by_0 no means_0 otherwise 15_0 albert einstein 1879–1955 stated that_1 as_0 far as_0 the laws of mathematics refer to_0 reality they_1 are_0 not_0

trying to_0 express itself 17 mathematics is_1 used_0 throughout the world_0 as_0 an_1 essential tool in many_0 fields including_1 natural science engineering medicine finance and_0 the_0 social sciences applied mathematics the branch of mathematics concerned with application of mathematical knowledge to_0 other fields inspires and makes use of new_1 mathematical discoveries which_1 has led to_0 the_0 development_1 of_0 entirely new_0 mathematical disciplines such_0 as_0 statistics and game theory mathematicians also_0 engage in pure mathematics or_0 mathematics for its_0 own sake
