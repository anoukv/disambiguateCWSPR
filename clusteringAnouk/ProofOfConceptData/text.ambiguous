after fans noticed mercurys increasingly gaunt appearance in 1988 rumours began to spread that mercury was suffering from aids mercury flatly denied this insisting he was merely exhausted and too busy to provide interviews 130  the band decided to continue making albums starting with the miracle in 1989 and continuing with innuendo in 1991 despite his deteriorating health the lead singer continued to contribute for the last two albums made while mercury was still alive the band credited all songs to queen rather than specific members of the group freeing them of internal conflict and

dries up completely at the end of its course and does not reach another body of water small rivers may be called by several other names including stream creek brook rivulet and rill there are no official definitions for generic terms such as river as applied to geographic features 2  although in some countries or communities a stream may be defined by its size many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location examples are run in the united states burn in scotland and northeast england and beck in northern england sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek 3  but not always the language is vague 4  im pole dancing and my hands are always sweaty dry hands never worked with me but firm grip really helps me i finally moved on with learning advanced tricks because im not afraid of slipping anymore this spotted cat most closely resembles the leopard physically although it is usually larger and of sturdier build and its behavioral and habitat characteristics are closer to those of the tiger while dense rainforest is its preferred habitat the jaguar will range across a variety of forested and open terrains it is strongly associated with the presence of water and is notable along with the tiger as a feline that enjoys swimming the jaguar is largely a solitary opportunistic stalkandambush predator at the top of the food chain an apex predator it is a keystone species playing an important role in stabilizing ecosystems and regulating the populations of the animals it hunts the jaguar has an exceptionally powerful bite even relative to the other big cats 3  this allows it to pierce the shells of armored reptiles 4  and to employ an unusual killing method it bites directly through the skull of prey between the ears to deliver a fatal bite to the brain 5  rivers are part of the hydrological cycle water generally collects in a river from precipitation through a drainage basin from surface runoff and other sources such as groundwater recharge springs and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks eg from glaciers potamology is the scientific study of rivers while limnology is the study of inland waters in general the jaguar is a near threatened species and its numbers are declining threats include loss and fragmentation of habitat while international trade in jaguars or their parts is prohibited the cat is still frequently killed by humans particularly in conflicts with ranchers and farmers in south america although reduced its range remains large given its historical distribution the jaguar has featured prominently in the mythology of numerous indigenous american cultures including those of the maya and aztec no extraterrestrial rivers are currently known though large flows of hydrocarbons described as rivers have recently been found on titan 5  6  channels may indicate past rivers on other planets specifically outflow channels on mars 7  and are theorised to exist on planets and moons in habitable zones of stars the worlds longest river is the nile on 23 november 1991 in a prepared statement made on his deathbed mercury confirmed that he had aids 139  within 24 hours of the

capitalist economies where most of them are privately owned and provide goods and services to customers for profit businesses may also be notforprofit or stateowned a business owned by multiple individuals may be referred to as a company although that term also has a more precise meaning clarification needed  the etymology of business stems from the state of being busy and implies commercially viable and profitable work the term business has at least three usages depending on the scope in which it is used a business can mean a particular organization while a more generalized usage refers to a particular market sector ie the music business compound forms such as agribusiness represent subsets of the words broadest meaning which encompasses all the activity by all the suppliers of goods and services a stream bank or riverbank consists of the terrain alongside the bed of a river creek or stream the grade of the bank can vary from vertical to a shallow slope the stream bank consists of the sides of the channel between which the flow is confined a bank sometimes referred to as a fishing bank is a part of the sea which is shallow compared to its surrounding area such as a shoal or the top of an underwater hill somewhat like continental slopes ocean banks slopes can upwell as tidal and other flows intercept them resulting sometimes in nutrient rich currents how  because of this some large banks such as dogger bank and the grand banks of newfoundland are among the richest fishing grounds in the world the jaguar ˈdʒæɡwɑr or uk ˈdʒæɡjuːər panthera onca is a big cat a feline in the panthera genus and is the only panthera species found in the americas the jaguar is the thirdlargest feline after the tiger and the lion and the largest in the western hemisphere the jaguars present range extends from southwestern united states and mexico across much of central america and south to paraguay and northern argentina apart from a known and possibly breeding population in arizona southeast of tucson the cat has largely been extirpated from the united states since the early 20th century there are some banks that were reported in the 19th century by navigators such as wachusett reef whose existence is doubtful on august 3 2009 bank of america agreed to pay a 33 million fine without admission or denial of charges to the us securities and exchange commission sec over the nondisclosure of an agreement to pay up to 58 billion of bonuses at merrill the bank approved the bonuses before the merger but did not disclose them to its shareholders when the shareholders were considering approving the merrill acquisition in december 2008 the issue was originally investigated by new york state attorney general andrew cuomo who commented after the suit and announced settlement that the timing of the bonuses as well as the disclosures relating to them constituted a surprising fit of corporate irresponsibility and our investigation of these and other matters pursuant to new yorks martin act will continue congressman kucinich commented at the same time that this may not be the last fine that bank of america pays for how it handled its merger of merrill lynch 64  a federal judge jed rakoff in an unusual action refused to approve the settlement on august 5 65  a first hearing before the judge on august 10 was at times heated and he was sharply critic al  of the bonuses david rosenfeld represented the sec and lewis j liman son of arthur l liman represented the bank the actual amount of bonuses paid was 36 billion of which 850 million was guaranteed and the rest was shared amongst 39000 workers who received average payments of 91000 696 people received more than 1 million in bonuses at least one person received a more than 33 million bonus 66  on september 14 the judge rejected the settlement and told the parties to prepare for trial to begin no later than february 1 2010 the judge focused much of his criticism on the fact that the fine in the case would be paid by the banks shareholders who were the ones that were supposed to have been injured by the lack of disclosure he wrote it is quite something else for the very management that is accused of having lied to its shareholders to determine how much of those victims’ money should be used to make the case against the management go away  the proposed settlement the judge continued suggests a rather cynical relationship between the parties the sec gets to claim that it is exposing wrongdoing on the part of the bank of america in a highprofile merger the banks management gets to claim that they have been coerced into an onerous settlement by overzealous regulators and all this is done at the expense not only of the shareholders but also of the truth 67  while ultimately deferring to the sec in february 2010 judge rakoff approved a revised settlement with a 150 million fine reluctantly calling the accord halfbaked justice at best and inadequate and misguided addressing one of the concerns he raised in september the fine will be distributed only to bank of america shareholders harmed by the nondisclosures or legacy shareholders an improvement on the prior 33 million while still paltry according to the judge case sec v bank of america corp 09cv06829 united states district court for the southern district of new york 68  investigations also were held on this issue in the united states house committee on oversight and government reform 67  under chairman edolphus towns dny 69  and in its investigative domestic policy subcommittee under kucinich 70  free range denotes a method of farming husbandry where the animals for at least part of the day can roam freely outdoors rather than being confined in an enclosure for 24hours each day 1  on many farms the outdoors ranging area is fenced thereby technically making this an enclosure however free range systems usually offer the opportunity for extensive locomotion and sunlight prevented by indoor housing systems free range may apply to meat eggs or dairy farming the term is used in two senses that do not overlap completely as a farmercentric description of husbandry methods and as a consumercentric description of them there is a diet where the practitioner only eats meat from freerange sources called ethical omnivorism which is a type of semivegetarian in ranching freerange livestock are permitted to roam without being fenced in as opposed to fencedin pastures in many of the agriculturebased economies freerange livestock are quite common on 20 april 1992 the freddie mercury tribute concert was held at londons wembley stadium to a 72000strong crowd 149  performers including def leppard robert plant guns n roses elton john david

species malus domestica in the rose family rosaceae it is one of the most widely cultivated tree fruits and the most widely known of the many members of genus malus that are used by humans apples grow on small deciduous trees the tree originated in central asia where its wild ancestor malus sieversii is still found today apples have been grown for thousands of years in asia and europe and were brought to north america by european colonists apples have been present in the mythology and religions of many cultures including norse greek and christian traditions in 2010 the fruits genome was decoded as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production there are more than 7500 known cultivars of apples resulting in a range of desired characteristics different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses including cooking fresh eating and cider production domestic apples are generally propagated by grafting although wild apples grow readily from seed trees are prone to a number of fungal bacterial and pest problems which can be controlled by a number of organic and nonorganic means about 69 million tons of apples were grown worldwide in 2010 and china produced almost half of this total the united states is the secondleading producer with more than 6 of world production turkey is third followed by italy india and poland apples are often eaten raw but can also be found in many prepared foods especially desserts and drinks many beneficial health effects are thought to result from eating apples however two forms of allergies are seen to various proteins found in the fruit apples are an important ingredient in many desserts such as apple pie apple crumble apple crisp and apple cake they are often eaten baked or stewed and they can also be dried and eaten or reconstituted soaked in water alcohol or some other liquid for later use puréed apples are generally known as apple sauce apples are also made into apple butter and apple jelly they are also used cooked in meat dishes one form of apple allergy often found in northern europe is called birchapple syndrome and is found in people who are also allergic to birch pollen 67  allergic reactions are triggered by a protein in apples that is similar to birch pollen and people affected by this protein can also develop allergies to other fruits nuts and vegetables reactions which entail oral allergy syndrome oas generally involve itching and inflammation of the mouth and throat 67  but in rare cases can also include lifethreatening anaphylaxis 68  this reaction only occurs when raw fruit is consumed—the allergen is neutralized in the cooking process the variety of apple maturity and storage conditions can change the amount of allergen present in individual fruits long storage times can increase the amount of proteins that cause birchapple syndrome apple juice concentrate has been found in mice to increase the production of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine 76  other studies have shown an alleviation of oxidative damage and cognitive decline in mice after the administration of apple juice 77  fruit flies fed an apple extract lived 10 longer than other flies fed a normal diet 78   the business of banking is in many english common law countries not defined by statute but by common law the definition above in other english common law jurisdictions there are statutory definitions of the business of banking or banking business when looking at these definitions it is important to keep in mind that they are defining the business of banking for the purposes of the legislation and not necessarily in general in particular most of the definitions are from legislation that has the purposes of entry regulating and supervising banks rather than regulating the actual business of banking however in many cases the statutory definition closely mirrors the common law one examples of statutory definitions a queen regnant plural queens regnant is a female monarch who reigns in her own right in contrast to a queen consort who is the wife of a reigning king an empress regnant is a female monarch who reigns in her own right over an empire a queen regnant possesses and exercises sovereign powers the husband of a queen regnant does not usually share his wifes rank title or sovereignty a queen consort shares her husbands rank and titles but does not share the sovereignty of her husband a queen dowager is the widow of a king who reigned in his own right a queen mother is a queen dowager who is also the mother of a reigning sovereign elizabeth met

home or kingdom some of the papers played long and loud tunes on the string of philips foreign origin 40  elizabeths mother was reported in later biographies to have opposed the union initially even dubbing philip the hun 41  in later life however she told biographer tim heald that philip was an english gentleman 42  before the marriage philip renounced his greek and danish titles converted from greek orthodoxy to anglicanism and adopted the style lieutenant philip mountbatten taking the surname of his mothers british family 43  just before the wedding he was created duke of edinburgh and granted the style his royal highness 44  elizabeth and philip were married on 20 november 1947 at westminster abbey they received 2500 wedding gifts from around the world 45  because britain had not

acceptable for the duke of edinburghs german relations including his three surviving sisters to be invited to the wedding 47  the duke of windsor formerly king edward viii was not invited either 48  elizabeth gave birth to her first child prince charles on 14 november 1948 one month earlier the king had issued letters patent allowing her children to use the style and title of a royal prince or

with a heavy head and beak even the smallest eagles like the booted eagle aquila pennata which is comparable in size to a common buzzard buteo buteo or redtailed hawk b jamaicensis have relatively longer and more evenly broad wings and more direct faster flight – despite the reduced size of aerodynamic feathers most eagles are larger than any other raptors apart from some vultures the smallest species of eagle is the south nicobar serpent eagle spilornis klossi at 450 g 1 lb and 40 cm 16 in the largest species are discussed below like all birds of prey eagles have very large hooked beaks for tearing flesh from their prey strong muscular legs and powerful talons the beak is typically heavier than that of most other birds of prey eagles eyes are extremely powerful having up to 36 times human acuity for the martial eagle which enables them to spot potential prey from a very long distance 2  this keen eyesight is primarily attributed to their extremely large pupils which ensure minimal diffraction scattering of the incoming light the female of all known species of eagle is larger than the male 3  4  eagles normally build their nests called eyries in tall trees or on high cliffs many species lay two eggs but the older larger chick frequently kills its younger sibling once it has hatched the dominant chick tends to be the female as they are bigger than the male the parents take no action to stop the killing 5  6  due to the size and power of many eagle species they are ranked at the top of the food chain as apex predators in the avian world the type of prey varies from genus to genus the haliaeetus and ichthyophaga eagles prefer to capture fish though the species in the former often capture various animals especially other water birds and are powerful kleptoparasites of other birds the snake and serpent eagles of the genera circaetus terathopius and spilornis predominantly prey on the great diversity of snakes that are found in the tropics of africa and asia the eagles of the genus aquila are often the top birds of prey in open habitats taking almost any mediumsized vertebrate they can catch where aquila eagles are absent other eagles such as the buteonine blackchested buzzardeagle of south america may assume the position of top raptorial predator in open areas many other eagles including the speciesrich spizaetus genus live predominantly in woodlands and forest these eagles often target various arboreal or grounddwelling mammals and birds which are often unsuspectingly ambushed in such dense knotty environments hunting techniques differ among the species and genera with some individual eagles having engaged in quite varied techniques based their environment and prey at any given time most eagles grab prey without landing and take flight with it so the prey can be carried to a perch and torn apart 7  the bald eagle is noted for having flown with the heaviest load verified to be carried by any flying bird since one eagle flew with a 68 kg 15 lb mule deer fawn 8  however a few eagles may target prey considerably heavier than themselves such prey is too heavy to fly with and thus it is either eaten at the site of the kill or taken in pieces back to a perch or nest golden and crowned eagles have killed ungulates weighing up to 30 kg 66 lb and a martial eagle even killed a 37 kg 82 lb duiker 7–8 times heavier than the predating eagle 7  9  authors on birds david allen sibley pete dunne and clay sutton described the behavioral difference between hunting eagles and other birds of prey thus in this case the bald and golden eagles as compared to other north american raptors 10  the beatles were an english rock band that formed in liverpool in 1960 with john lennon paul mccartney george harrison and ringo

brother hilary arthur reuel who was born on 17 february 1894 15  as a child he was bitten by a large baboon spider in the garden an event some think later echoed in his stories although tolkien admitted no actual memory of the event and no special hatred of spiders as an adult in another incident a young family servant who thought tolkien a beautiful child took the baby to his kraal to show him off returning him the next morning 16  when he was three he went to england with his mother and brother on what was intended to be a lengthy family visit his father however died in south africa of

yellow ochre hematite manganese oxide and charcoal may have been made by early homo sapiens as long as 40000 years ago ancient colored walls at dendera egypt which were exposed for years to the elements still possess their brilliant color as vivid as when they were painted about 2000 years ago the egyptians mixed their colors with a gummy substance and applied them separately from each other without any blending or mixture they appear to have used six colors white black blue red yellow and green they first covered the area entirely with white then traced the design in black leaving out the lights of the ground color they used minium for red and generally of a dark tinge pliny mentions some painted ceilings in his day in the town of ardea which had been done prior to the foundation of rome he expresses great surprise and admiration at their freshness after the lapse of so many centuries paint was made with the yolk of eggs and therefore the substance would harden and adhere to the surface it was applied to pigment was made from plants sand and different soils most paints used either oil or water as a base the dilutant solvent or vehicle for the pigment  history from greek ἱστορία historia meaning inquiry knowledge acquired by investigation 2  is the study of the past specifically how it relates to humans 3  4  it is an umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the discovery collection organization and presentation of information about these events the term includes cosmic geologic and organic history but is often generically implied to mean human history scholars who write about history are called historians events occurring prior to written record are considered prehistory history can also refer to the academic discipline which uses a narrative to examine and analyse a sequence of past events and objectively determine the patterns of cause and effect that determine them 5  6  historians sometimes debate the nature of history and its usefulness by discussing the study of the discipline as an end in itself and as a way of providing perspective on the problems of the present 5  7  8  9  stories common to a particular culture but not supported by external sources such as the tales surrounding king arthur are usually classified as cultural heritage or legends because they do not support the disinterested investigation required of the discipline of history 10  11  herodotus a 5thcentury bc greek historian is considered within the western tradition to be the father of history and along with his contemporary thucydides helped form the foundations for the modern study of human history their work continues to be read today and the divide between the culturefocused herodotus and the militaryfocused thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in modern historical writing in the eastern tradition a state chronicle the spring and autumn annals was known to be compiled from as early as 722 bc although only 2nd century bc texts survived ancient influences have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today the modern study of history is wideranging and includes the study of specific regions and the study of certain topical or thematical elements of historical investigation often history is taught as part of primary and secondary education and the academic study of history is a major discipline in university studies a still extant example of 17thcentury house oil painting is ham house in surrey england where a primer was used along with several undercoats and an elaborate decorative overcoat the pigment and oil mixture would have been ground into a paste with a mortar and pestle the process was done by hand by the painters and exposed them to lead poisoning due to the whitelead powder in 1718 marshall smith invented a machine or engine for the grinding of colours in england it is not known precisely how it operated but it was a device that increased the efficiency of pigment grinding dramatically soon a company called emerton and manby was advertising exceptionally lowpriced paints that had been ground with laboursaving technology one pound of colour ground in a horsemill will paint twelve yards of work whereas colour ground any other way will not do half that quantity by the proper onset of the industrial revolution paint was being ground in steampowered mills and an alternative to leadbased pigments was found in a white derivative of zinc oxide interior house painting increasingly became the norm as the 19th century progressed both for decorative reasons and because the paint was effective in preventing the walls rotting from damp linseed oil was also increasingly used as an inexpensive binder in 1866 sherwinwilliams in the united states opened as a large paintmaker and invented a paint that could be used from the tin without preparation it was not until the stimulus of world war ii created a shortage of linseed oil in the supply markets that artificial resins or alkyds were invented cheap and easy to make they also held the color well and lasted for a long time 2

taught him a great deal of botany and awakened in him the enjoyment of the look and feel of plants young tolkien liked to draw landscapes and trees but his favourite lessons were those concerning languages and his mother taught him the rudiments of latin very early 22  he could read by the age of four and could write fluently soon afterwards his mother allowed him to read many books he disliked treasure island and the pied piper and thought alices adventures in wonderland by lewis carroll was amusing but disturbing he liked stories about red indians and the fantasy works by george macdonald 23  in addition the fairy books of andrew lang were particularly important to him and their influence is apparent in some of his later writings 24    king edwards school in birmingham where

worcestershire 27  nine years after her death tolkien wrote my own dear mother was a martyr indeed and it is not to everybody that god grants so easy a way to his great gifts as he did to hilary and myself giving us a mother who killed herself with labour and trouble to ensure us keeping the faith 28  prior to her death mabel tolkien had assigned the guardianship of her sons to her close friend fr francis xavier morgan of the birmingham oratory who was assigned to bring them up as good catholics in a 1965 letter to his son michael tolkien recalled the influence of his guardian  morgan  was an upperclass welshspaniard tory and seemed to some just a pottering old gossip he was—and he was not i first learned charity and forgiveness from him and in the light of it pierced even the liberal darkness out of which i came knowing more about bloody mary than the mother of jesus—who was never mentioned except as an object of wicked worship by the romanists 29  after his mothers death tolkien grew up in the edgbaston area of birmingham and attended king edwards school birmingham and later st philips school in 1903 he won a foundation scholarship and returned to king edwards while a pupil

was posted just outside the gates of buckingham palace 30  in edgbaston tolkien lived there in the shadow of perrotts folly and the victorian tower of edgbaston waterworks which may have influenced

all written work writing that possesses literary merit and language that foregrounds literariness as opposed to ordinary language etymologically the term derives from latin literaturalitteratura writing formed with letters although some definitions include spoken or sung texts literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or nonfiction and whether it is poetry or prose it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel short story or drama and works are often categorised according to historical periods or according to their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations genre taken to mean only written works literature was first produced by some of the worlds earliest civilizations—those of ancient egypt and sumeria—as early as the 4th millennium bc taken to include spoken or sung texts it originated even earlier and some of the first written works may have been based on an alreadyexisting oral tradition as urban cultures and

the first twentyfour hours of preordering 195  and over five million handsets were sold in the first three days of its launch 196  a patent filed in july 2013 revealed the development of a new iphone battery system that uses location data in combination with data on the users habits to moderate the handsets power settings accordingly apple is working towards a power management system that will provide features such as the ability of the iphone to estimate the length of time a user will be away from a power source to modify energy usage and a detection function that adjusts the charging rate to best suit the type of power source that is being used 197  in mathematics the range of a function refers to either the codomain or the image of the function depending upon usage the codomain is a set containing the functions outputs whereas the image is the part of the codomain which consists only of the functions outputs in march 2013 one of the largest cellular phone companies in the united

through capital markets a bank links together customers that have capital deficits and customers with capital surpluses according to the prevailing scientific model of the universe known as the big bang the universe expanded from an extremely hot dense phase called the planck epoch in which all the matter and energy of the observable universe was concentrated since the planck epoch the universe has been expanding to its present form possibly with a brief period less than 10−32 seconds of cosmic inflation several independent experimental measurements support this theoretical expansion and more generally the big bang theory the universe is composed of ordinary matter 5 including atoms stars and galaxies dark matter 25 which is a hypothetical particle that has not yet been detected and dark energy 70 which is a kind of energy density that seemingly exists even in completely empty space 15  recent observations indicate that this expansion is accelerating because of dark energy and that most of the matter in the universe may be in a form which cannot be detected by present instruments called dark matter 16  the common use of the dark matter and dark energy placeholder names for the unknown entities purported to account for about 95 of the massenergy density of the universe demonstrates the present observational and conceptual shortcomings and uncertainties concerning the nature and ultimate fate of the universe 17  the eagles are an american rock band formed in los angeles in 1971 by glenn frey don henley bernie leadon and randy meisner with five numberone singles six
